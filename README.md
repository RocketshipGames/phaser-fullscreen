# Phaser Fullscreen

A simple Phaser game example and project template for fullscreen
support.  The intent is to demonstrate how to properly work with
fullscreening on desktop and mobile, as well as to provide a blank
template from which to start new projects.

There are two components:

 * [Single-File Example](html/singlefile.html): An example fullscreen
   "game" self-contained in a single file, except for a few libraries
   and assets, structured much like the Phaser examples.

 * [State-Based Project Template](html/index.html): An example with
   multiple files and classes utilizing Phaser's state system, more
   suitable than the single-file as a template for a larger project.

The single-file example is running and a few more comments available
in [this blog post](http://www.rocketshipgames.com/blogs/tjkopena/2014/10/fullscreen-scaling-in-phaser/).
